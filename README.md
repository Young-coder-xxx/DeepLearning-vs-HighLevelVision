# Deep Learning vs High Level Vision

This project contains both a computational (Deep Learning models) and psychophysics part (psiTurk).

This repository contains the code and images used for the publication ["Can Deep Learning Recognize Subtle Human Activities?"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13852).
